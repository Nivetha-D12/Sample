TDD(test driven development)

*It is fail first software development methodology.
*In first it will write a test to fail
*Then write the code to make test pass.
*Refactor the test and repeated the process till the end of functionality.

BDD(behavior driven development)

*it is also a software development methodology.
*it is application which is designd to describe how its behavior should appear to user
*acceptance criteria is used to define the behavior(it is written in plain english before test)

Gherkin language

*In BDD Framework writing scenario is using special language called gherkin language
*Gherkin language has certain keywords like;
     -Feature
     -Scenario
     -Given,When,Then,And,But(Steps)
     -Background
     -Scenario Outline
     -Examples

Feature - it descrbe the feature,for which acceptance test is written.only one feature keyword per file.
Scenario - it describe the scenario,we can have multiple scenario in a feature
Given - it defines the precondition of scenario
When - it defines the action,which user will take on application
Then - it define the outcome of when action
And - it define the additional condition with other keywords
The file which as these function is called feature file which should have .feature extension
Step Definiion - for every step in feature file,there will be corresponding java method.the method will have test logic and it is called step definition.
